Finch Drama Project
===================

The [Personal Robotics Lab][] at [Carnegie Mellon University][] is beginning a new
project in January 2016 led by [Dr. Garth Zeglin][] to develop a middle-school
level curriculum for creating dramatic performances using small mobile robots.
We are using the [Finch Robot][] platform sold by [BirdBrain Technologies][],
although the core ideas could be ported to other devices.  We are using the
[Snap!][Snap] visual programming system.

This repository contains course materials and sample code in Snap! for creating
dramatic performances using Finch robots.

Contents
--------

The text/ folder contains the course materials in readable HTML form, including
exercises, tutorials, and reference guides.  The text is offered under a [CC-BY-SA][]
Creative Commons license.

The Snap/ folder contains backup copies of the Snap! sketches used in the
exercises.  Note that these will tend to be out of date with respect to the
working versions stored on the Snap cloud servers.  The code is offered under a
BSD license.

The server/ folder contains the Python code for a blackboard server useful for
setting up communications between Snap sketches.

The sphinx/ folder contains the input files for generating the course materials
in text/ using the Sphinx documentation system.

Note to Co-Authors
------------------

The gh-pages branch contains both the [main project web page][] and all other
downloadable materials.  The gh-pages branch should be considered the stable or
release branch.  The master branch should be used as the development branch,
with all changes eventually merged to gh-pages.
