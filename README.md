Finch Drama Project
===================

The [Personal Robotics Lab][] at [Carnegie Mellon University][] is beginning a new
project in January 2016 led by [Dr. Garth Zeglin][] to develop a middle-school
level curriculum for creating dramatic performances using  small mobile robots.
We are using the [Finch Robot][] platform sold by [BirdBrain Technologies][],
although the core ideas could be ported to other devices.  We are using the
[Snap!][Snap] visual programming system.

This repository contains course materials and sample code in Snap! for creating
dramatic performances using Finch robots.

Contents
--------

The Snap/ folder contains backup copies of the Snap! sketches used in the
exercises.  Note that these will tend to be out of date with respect to the
working versions stored on the Snap cloud serves.  The code is offered under a
BSD license.

The gh-pages branch contains the [main project web page][], with links to additional resources.

Currently all course materials are stored separately in a
[Google Drive Folder][].  The text is offered under a [CC-BY-SA][] license.
