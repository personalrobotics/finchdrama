Exercise - Interacting Like Robots
==================================

For these pair and ensemble exercises, we will explore how we can express
interactions and conversations between robots by puppeting objects with our hands.


Expressive Interaction
----------------------

Drama is all about interactions: people talk, fight, love, collaborate,
co-exist.  It reflects and exaggerates our own daily life social interactions.
Representing that using robots involves condensing the richness of human
experience to much simpler movements and rhythms.  A good abstraction of this
interaction can suggest the fuller experience and the audience will read their
own experience into what they see.

Improvising movement with a partner is much easier when we feel our efforts will
be accepted.  For the following, a good rule of thumb is to always think "Yes,
and..."  whatever someone else does: accept it, and then build on it.  This will
help foster a spirit of collaboration.


Part 1: Taking Turns
--------------------

#. Choose an object to represent your 'robot'.  It can be anything: a glove, a
   book, an actual robot.  You will move this object with your hands as if it
   were a two-wheeled robot.

#. Stand up, find a partner, and move to a clear area of the floor.

#. Each partner should choose an attitude to portray with respect to their
   partner.  Some examples: shyness, curiosity, fear, interest.

#. Each partner should choose an action which is characteristic for that
   attitude.  E.g. the shy robot might turns its back; the curious robot might
   explore.

#. Pick which partner goes first.  One partner performs their action, then the
   other partner responds.  Try to respond with an action consistent with your
   robot attitude, and with movements within the robot capabilities.

#. Then the second partner can take the initiative, and the first partner respond.

#. After a few rounds, pick a different attitude and action and try again.
   
   

Part 2: Tempo
-------------

#. Change partners.

#. Try the same exercise again.  Then try to tighten the timing, see if you can
   smoothly flow between movement and response and back again.

#. Do it again, twice as fast.

#. Do it again, half as fast.   


Discussion
----------

These small actions can become events which reveal character and advance a plot,
i.e., the units of a story.  The larger goal here is to abstract the story
itself into an essence which can be conveyed by the robots as our proxies, just
as these actions are abstractions of human actions and emotions.
