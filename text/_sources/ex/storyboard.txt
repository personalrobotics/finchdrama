Exercise - Developing the Storyboard
====================================

This exercise addresses developing concrete details for a specific vignette.
This builds upon the treatment developed in :ref:`exercise-theming` and moves
toward a fully realized scene.

Drawing the Storyboard
----------------------

Storyboarding is a well-established method in cinema production to plan and
previsualize a series of scenes via sketches.  The first objective of this
exercise is to draw a storyboard which graphically renders the story as
described in the treatment.  The storyboard can serve as a focal point both for
discussion within the team and for communicating the complete idea to the
cinematographer.  Please see the storyboard worksheet below for the following
discussion.

The sequence for this project should be no longer than 30 seconds.  This may be
divided into several individual shots to show action from different viewpoints.
The selection of camera angles is as much as part of the storytelling as the
action.

The worksheet contains four sections for planning individual shots.  For each,
please sketch a simple line drawing representing the scene as seen by the camera
for that shot.  Feel free to add arrows or flow lines which indicate the
direction of action for each visible character.  On the right hand side, please
describe the elements of the shot and scene, and write out any dialogue in full.

It may be helpful to puppet the robot across a tabletop by hand while choosing
the precise movements.  One team member can move each robot, while another acts
as cinematographer and frames each camera view using two hands.


Rehearsal Preparation
---------------------

Once the action and dialogue are decided, the next step is to develop the robot
programming to the point where the performance can be fully enacted in a
real-time scene rehearsal.
