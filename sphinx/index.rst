Course Guide
############

The `Finch Drama Project`_ is an effort to develop a curriculum around creating
dramatic performances using small mobile robots.  This is the reference guide
containing course tutorials and exercises.  It is written to be accessible to
middle-school students, but could be used at a variety of levels.

We are using the `Finch Robot`_ platform sold by `BirdBrain Technologies`_,
although the core ideas could be ported to other devices.  We are using the
`Snap!`_ visual programming system.

The Finch Drama Project was started in January 2016 by `Dr. Garth Zeglin`_ as a
project of the `Personal Robotics Lab`_ within the `Robotics Institute`_ and
`School of Computer Science`_ at `Carnegie Mellon University`_.

Quick Start
===========

The fastest way to jump into the materials with a Finch Robot is to try out the
example programs ('sketches') listed below.  They will load the browser-based
`Snap!`_ programming system.

Technical Requirements
----------------------

To run the examples, you will need:

* a `Finch Robot`_ with USB cable
* a computer running the Chrome browser (Windows, OS X, Linux, or Chromebook)
* the `Chrome Finch Connection App`_
* an active network connection

The best detailed instructions on getting started are found at `Finch Chromebook
Support`_.  Please note that these examples will not work with the BirdBrain
Robot Server as it uses an incompatible system for communicating between Snap!
and the robot.


Snap! Sketches

These work best in the Chrome browser:

#. `Robot Sequencing <http://snap.berkeley.edu/snapsource/snap.html#cloud:Username=prldrama&ProjectName=Finch-Sequencing>`__
#. `Precise Coordination <http://snap.berkeley.edu/snapsource/snap.html#cloud:Username=prldrama&ProjectName=Finch-Precise-Coordination>`__

BirdBrain also hosts `several other curriculum examples using Snap and Scratch
<Finch Snap Curricula_>`_.
