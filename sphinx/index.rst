Course Guide

The `Finch Drama Project`_ is an effort to develop a curriculum for creating
dramatic performances using small mobile robots.  The course is geared for a
middle-school level. We are using the `Finch Robot`_ platform sold by `BirdBrain
Technologies`_, although the core ideas could be ported to other devices.  We
are using the `Snap!`_ visual programming system.  This is the reference guide
containing course tutorials and exercises.

The Finch Drama Project was started in January 2016 by `Dr. Garth Zeglin`_ as a
project of the `Personal Robotics Lab`_ within the `Robotics Institute`_ and
`School of Computer Science`_ at `Carnegie Mellon University`_.

Quick Start
===========

The fastest way to try out the materials with a Finch Robot is to jump into the
example programs ('sketches') in `Snap!`_.

Technical Requirements
----------------------

To run the examples, you will need:

  * a `Finch Robot`_ with USB cable
  * a computer running the Chrome browser (Windows, OS X, Linux, or Chromebook)
  * the `Chrome Finch Connection App`_
  * an active network connection

The best detailed instructions on getting started are found on `Finch Chromebook
Support`_.  Please note that the
examples will not work with the BirdBrain Robot Server as it uses an
incompatible system for communicating between Snap! and the robot.


Snap! Sketches
--------------

These work best in the Chrome browser:

    #. `State Machine <http://snap.berkeley.edu/snapsource/snap.html#cloud:Username=prldrama&ProjectName=Finch-State-Machine>`__
    #. `Network Communication <http://snap.berkeley.edu/snapsource/snap.html#cloud:Username=prldrama&ProjectName=Sprite-Communication-Intro>`__
    #. `Sensorless Parking <http://snap.berkeley.edu/snapsource/snap.html#cloud:Username=prldrama&ProjectName=Finch-Sensorless-Parking>`__
    #. `Robot Synchronization <http://snap.berkeley.edu/snapsource/snap.html#cloud:Username=prldrama&ProjectName=Finch-Coordination-Intro>`__
    #. `Robot Sequencing <http://snap.berkeley.edu/snapsource/snap.html#cloud:Username=prldrama&ProjectName=Finch-Sequencing>`__
    #. `Precise Coordination <http://snap.berkeley.edu/snapsource/snap.html#cloud:Username=prldrama&ProjectName=Finch-Precise-Coordination>`__

BirdBrain also hosts `several other curriculum examples using Snap and Scratch
<Finch Snap Curricula_>`_.
