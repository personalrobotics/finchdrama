Introduction
************

This text is the companion guide to a curriculum for creating performances with
robots.  It is written to be accessible to middle-school students, but could be
used at a variety of levels.

The essential skill is to understand the meaning of movement, action, and form
in context well enough to convey a performance idea via a machine.
Accomplishing this using a robot requires finding insight into performance by
robot proxy as well as learning analytic and programming skills.

The text is written for the `Finch Robot`_ platform sold by `BirdBrain
Technologies`_, and uses the `Snap!`_ visual programming system.  However, the
core ideas are general and this course could be ported to other languages and
robots.


Prerequisites
=============

The text assumes that students are already familiar with the basic use of
`Snap!`_.  Students already familiar with `Scratch`_ may need to study a few of
the additional features provided by Snap.

The exercises assume students are already familiar with these basic programming
ideas in Snap:

  #. imperative programming as sequences of commands
  #. atomic data representation as numbers and strings
  #. the idea of composite data representation as lists
  #. creating functions with arguments
  #. state machine transition diagrams and implementation
  
And these topics related to robotics:

  #. issuing robot commands to change physical state (wheel velocity, LED color)
  #. controlling timing of actions using delays
  #. sampling robot sensors to estimate physical state (proximity sensors,
     accelerometer)


Learning Goals
==============

The following topics include the essential learning goals related to robot performance:

  #. capturing human performance via robot
  #. improvising with robots
  #. formulating an interaction (pas de deux or dialogue)
  #. the role of rhythm
  #. ensemble choreography
  #. creating meaning through context: story, setting, costuming
  #. writing a script for video-recorded performance
  #. writing a script for live performance
     
Accomplishing these objectives will require learning more fundamentals
of robotics including the following:

  #. using data to represent actions and trajectories
  #. using a networked key-value store
  #. using a distributed protocol
  #. graphical analysis of the convex hull
  #. the definition of uncertainty
  #. graphical reasoning about capture regions
  #. creating primitives for sensorless navigation
  #. designing environmental features for navigational assistance

Implementing these ideas will require new programming skills including the
following:

  #. using lists as structured data: arrays, association lists
  #. essential functional programming: values, iteration, and mapping
  #. understanding recursive functions
