Finch Drama Project
===================

The `Personal Robotics Lab`_ at `Carnegie Mellon University`_ is beginning a new
project in January 2016 led by `Dr. Garth Zeglin`_ to develop a middle-school
level curriculum for creating dramatic performances using  small mobile robots.
We are using the `Finch Robot`_ platform sold by `BirdBrain Technologies`_,
although the core ideas could be ported to other devices.  We are using the
`Snap!`_ visual programming system.

This page is currently just the launchpoint toward the actual resources:

  * `Curriculum Materials (hosted on Google Drive) <Lessons Folder_>`_

BirdBrain also hosts `several other curriculum examples using Snap and Scratch
<Finch Snap Curricula_>`_.

Technical Requirements
----------------------

To run the examples, you will need:

  * a Finch with USB cable
  * a computer running the Chrome browser (Windows, OS X, Linux, or Chromebook)
  * the `Chrome Finch Connection App`_

The best detailed instructions on getting started are found on `Finch Chromebook
Support`_.  Please note that the
examples will not work with the BirdBrain Robot Server as it uses an
incompatible system for communicating between Snap! and the robot.
